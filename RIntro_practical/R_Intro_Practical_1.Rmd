These introductory practicals are designed to teach you the basics of R. At the end, we expect you to be able to follow along with the other practicals of this course. Save your R-script or paste your answers in a document and mail it to l.j.sinke@lumc.nl.  

***

## Part 1: Finding your way around RStudio

Open RStudio  

After opening a new R-script with `ctrl + shift + N`, you should have a layout similar to the image below.  

![Figure 1](https://github.com/molepi/Molecular-Data-Science/blob/master/RIntro_practical/figure.png?raw=true)  

You can type equations in the *Console* (see Figure) and R will calculate the result. Try this by typing the following equation in the Console:  

```{r}
1 + 1     
```

***

You can also type your code in the *R-script* (see Figure) and run a line or a selection using `ctrl + enter`. This is preferable to typing in the *Console* directly, since you can save the scripts for later use or share them with collaborators. Additionally, scripts can be commented using `#` to improve their readability.  

Copy the following equations in your *R-script*, place your cursor on the first line, and run the equations line-by-line. You can also select multiple lines and run them together.

```
5 - 2         # subtraction
2 * 2         # multiplication
6 / 2         # division
3 ^ 2         # exponentiation
sqrt(9)       # square root
abs(-5)       # modulus
```

***

Using the `up arrow` and `down arrow`, you can scroll through historical commands. These can also be viewed in the **History** tab of the *Environment* section (see Figure).

In the **Environment** tab of the *Environment* section, you can view any stored variables available for use.  

You can store values in variables using the assignment operator, `<-`. Note that variable names in R are case-sensitive.

```{r}
x <- 1 + 1
x
```

You can list all currently saved variables, or remove them from memory. Remember, `rm()` is irreversible. If you want to use the variable again, you will need to redefine it.    

```{r}
ls()        # list all stored variables
rm(x)       # removing x
ls()

x <- 1 + 1  # redefining x
```

***

In the *bottom right* section of RStudio, are some very useful tabs. **Files** will display the content of the current working directory. You can set this using `setwd()` and view the path using `getwd()`.

Any **Plots** that you create can also be viewed here, and you can browse through your plot history with the `Forward` and `Back` buttons. 

A list of currently installed packages is shown in the **Packages** tab. The functions contained within these can be loaded into R with the `library()` function. Try loading the graphics packages mentioned in the lecture, ggplot2.  

```{r warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

We will use this package later in the practical. After loading a package into R, the functions become available for use.

Lastly, the **Help** tab can be used to view documentation on any loaded function. Find help on the function, `mean`.

```
?mean
```

*** 

## Part 2: Vectors

You can store multiple values in a vector using the concatenate function, `c()`.

```{r}
y <- c(5, 6, 7)
y
```

You can perform calculations on elements of a vector, using the same operators and functions you saw above. 

```{r}
x + y
y * 3
y ^ 2
```

***

You can also sum the elements of a vector using `sum()`, view the maximum value using `max()`, or return the number of elements using `length()`. Additionally, vectors can be reversed using `rev()`.   

```{r}
sum(y)
max(y)
length(y)
rev(y)
```

***

You can select specific values from a vector using square brackets. A sequence of values can be defined with `:`. Values can also be added to currently defined vectors using `c()`.  

```{r}
y[1]        # Return the first value of y
y[2:3]      # Return the second and third value of y
c(y, 8)     # Add an 8 as the last element of y
y[-3]       # Return all except the third value of y
```

***

Some functions can help you explore the nature of stored variables.   

```{r}
str(y)
class(y)
```

***

In this case, `y` is a numeric class object. A vector can also contain character data, defined using quotation marks.

```{r}
z <- c("a", "b", "c")
z
c(z, "d")
class(z)
```

***

In addition to the above methods, there are other ways to subset vectors in R.  

```{r}
y[c(1, 3)]    # Return the first and third value of y
z[c(T,T,F)]   # Return the first and second value of y
y[y == 6]     # Return all values of y equal to 6
z[z != "a"]   # Return all values of z not equal to "a"
y[y > 5]      # Return all values of y greater than 5
```

***

#### Question 1: Obtain the following vectors by adding, removing or subsetting vectors y or z. There are multiple ways to do this, but you only need to give one of them in your answers.

* `7`
* `"a", "c"`
* `5, 7, 9`
* `"c", "b", "a"`

***

## Part 3: Data Frames

R also has a data frame class which you could compare to a spreadsheet.  

You can click on a data frame in the **Environment** to view it. However, when the data frame is large it is better to use functions such as `str`, `summary`, `head` and `dim`.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(y, z)  # Create a data frame from vectors y and z
df
class(df)
str(df)
summary(df)
```

***

You can view the dimensions of a data frame.

```{r}
nrow(df)
ncol(df)
dim(df)
```

***

You can add row names and column names to a data frame.  

```{r}
rownames(df) <- c("row1", "row2", "row3")
colnames(df) <- c("col1", "col2")
df
```

***

You can subset data frames in a similar manner to vectors, or using the `$` operator.  

```{r}
df[1, ]           # Return the first row
df[, 1]           # Return the first column
df[1, 1]          # Return the first value in the first column
df$col1           # Return column 'col1'
df[df$col1 > 5, ] # Return rows where column 'col1' is greater than 5
```

***

Extra columns can be added to a data frame using the `$` operator. This column is of the logical class, where `T` represents TRUE and `F` represents FALSE. These can also be used for subsetting as shown above.   

```{r}
df$col3 <- c(T, T, F) 
df
```

Adding extra rows requires the `rbind()` function, and for values of the new row to be of the correct class.

```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(col1 = 8, col2 = "d", col3 = F) 
rownames(df2) <- "row4" 
df3 <- rbind(df, df2) 
df3
```

***

#### Question 2:

* Add a column with the name `col4` to data frame `df` with the values `1, 1, 1`.
* Make a new data frame `df4` which is a subset of data frame `df` but only contains columns `col1` and `col2`, and rows `row2` and `row3`.
* Calculate the sum of `col1` of data frame `df3`.
* Change the row names of data frame `df4` to `rowX` and `rowY`.

***

## Part 4: Real Data

We are now going to load a data set from the Framingham heart study [BioLINCC](https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/). This data is stored as a .csv file, so we read it into R using `read.csv()`.

```{r}
fhs <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molepi/Molecular-Data-Science/master/RIntro_practical/data.csv"))
```

First, we will explore the data.  

```{r}
str(fhs)
summary(fhs)
head(fhs)
```

From looking at the above, we can see that this data frame contains 4434 observations of 12 variables. The first 11 variables represent values measured at baseline (e.g. sex, age), and the last variable, MI, represents whether of not the individual had suffered a myocardial infarction at 24 years after baseline. 

***

There are 642 missing values in the data. While there are various methods to handle these, we will look only at complete cases in this instance by removing observations with missing values.

```{r}
sum(is.na(fhs))
fhs <- fhs[complete.cases(fhs), ]
sum(is.na(fhs))
```

***

Formula class objects are used across multiple functions in R, including those for cross tabulation and regression. For example, we can define a model where `y` depends on `x` using the `~` and `+` operators.

```{r}
f <- y ~ x + z
class(f)
```

***

We make use of this and create tables of variables in our data using `xtabs()` and `prop.table()`.  

```{r}
xtabs(~ MI, fhs)              # Table of MI in FHS
prop.table(xtabs(~ MI, fhs))  # Proportion table of MI in FHS
xtabs(~ MI + SEX, fhs)        # Table of MI by SEX
xtabs(~ MI, fhs[fhs$AGE>50, ])# Table of MI in individuals over 50
```

***

#### Question 3:

* Make a table of CURSMOKE
* Make a proportion table of BPMEDS
* Make a table of EDUC for individuals who smoke
* Cross tabulate SEX and DIABETES

***

## Part 5: Visualisations of Distributions

Packages like `ggplot2`, which we loaded into R earlier, can extend the functionality of R. This package is commonly used to produce visualisations of data. 

The plots will appear in the **Plots** pane, you can save the plots using the Export button if you would like.

The `ggplot` function works by adding `geom` elements. For example, `geom_density` can be used to investigate the distribution of a variable.

```{r}
ggplot(fhs, aes(BMI)) + geom_density()
```

This is not really a very pretty visualisation, however. One of the nice aspects of `ggplot2` is that you can iteratively build up graphics until they look as you want them to.  

***

Let's add some nicer colours and a title.

```{r}
ggplot(fhs, aes(BMI)) + 
  geom_density(fill="#72B6C5", color="#ffffff00", alpha=0.6) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of BMI in the Framingham Heart Study")
```

***

We can also look at variable's distribution using a bar plot with `geom_bar` or a histogram with `geom_histogram`.

```{r}
ggplot(fhs, aes(SEX)) + 
  geom_bar(fill="#72B6C5", color="grey90", alpha=0.6) +
  ggtitle("Bar plot of sex in the Framingham Heart Study")
```

***

Some themes are also available for use with `ggplot`.

```{r}
ggplot(fhs, aes(AGE)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color="grey90", alpha=0.6) + theme_bw() +
  ggtitle("Histogram of age in the Framingham Heart Study")
```

***

Maybe we want to view ages in males and females separately. For this, we can use `facet_grid`.

```{r}
ggplot(fhs, aes(x=AGE, fill=SEX)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color="grey90", alpha=0.6) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of age by sex in the Framingham Heart Study") +
  facet_grid(SEX ~ .)
```

***

You can quickly build up attractive graphics in R. Subsetting can also be utilised within `ggplot2`.  

Say, we want to visualise the distribution of age by sex only in overweight individuals.

```{r}
ggplot(fhs[fhs$BMI > 30, ], aes(x=AGE, fill=SEX)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, color="grey90", alpha=0.6) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of age by sex in the Framingham Heart Study") +
  facet_grid(SEX ~ .)
```

***

#### Question 4:

* Make a bar plot of MI
* Make a histogram of TOTCHOL
* Make a density plot of GLUCOSE for individuals with diabetes
* Make a histogram of SYSBP by SEX for those who experienced MI

## See you tomorrow!

Hopefully, this introduction to the basics of R was informative and helpful. Tomorrow, we will start by diving into variable comparison using more graphics and statistical tests.
