# Molecular Data Science: from disease mechanisms to personalized medicine
## Focus of the course: *Molecular Epidemiology in Ageing research* #

Biomedical research increasingly involves the generation and analysis of very large data sets whether it is whole-genome DNA sequencing, gene expression or magnetic resonance imaging data. In particular, large-scale data will be the cornerstone of personalized medicine. This course is aimed at biomedical students who not only want to be responsible for the generation of large-scale data in their future projects, but also want to be able to analyse and interpret their own data.

Literature and documents for study assignments will be handed out during the course.



#### Coordinators #### 

Bas Heijmans, Molecular Epidemiology; 071-526 69785, B.T.Heijmans@lumc.nl 

Ingrid Meulenbelt, Molecular Epidemiology; 071-526 9734, i.meulenbelt@lumc.nl 

#### Location ####

Leiden University Medical Center, Albinusdreef 2, 2333 ZA Leiden: room J1-84 at the main building. 
For the practicals, computers in J1-84 will be used.

#### Storing valuables ####

Store valuables, especially during breaks, in one of
the lockers available for library users, located on the left of the
library entrance.

### Assessment plan ###

-	Handing in assignments (Pass/Fail, individually assessed).
-	Contribute to interim evaluation of student participation and development during workgroups (0%).
-	Fill out project proposal form as preparation for reflective assignment (0%).
-	Presentation project proposal (background, hypothesis, pilot data, objectives, study design, workplan, expected outcomes; 45%, assessed in duos).
-	Active and critical participation during discussion after project presentations of peers (15%, individually assessed).
-	Reflective assignment that shows mastering key aspects of development of research proposal in molecular data science and addressing points raised during peer review (40%, individually assessed).

Overall the evaluation will be a score between 0-10 composed of a weighted average of the different modules.

#### Evaluation ####

For individual evaluation of students, the module coordinators of the
first 2 weeks will judge the following: 

- participation in the (paper) discussions 
- answers to the questions in the practicals

The module coordinators of the third week will judge the following:

- written project proposal 
- oral project defense

Overall the evaluation will be a score between 0-10 composed of a
weighted average of the different modules.


## PART 1 Acquiring knowledge and skills ##

Knowledge with respect to complex diseases and the different study
designs available to investigate. In the practicals students will
acquire skills (bioinformatic and statistical tools) how large
datasets of genetic, gene expression and phenotypic data are analysed
for pattern recognition in the data and to match results with existing
biological information and to form new hypotheses.

## PART 2. Applying acquired knowledge and skill to ageing. ##

Students will apply newly acquired competences to write a research proposal 
that follows a data science approach to study ageing as a key example of a complex human trait. 
Students will work on developing a project proposal in duos. Generating pilot data by analyzing available ‘real’ omics data sets to support hypotheses will be an integral part of the project proposal. During the week there will be regular moments of interaction with the module coordinators and the possibility to contact other tutors of the course.
